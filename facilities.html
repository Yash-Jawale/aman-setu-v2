						<h1>School Facilities</h1>
						<p>
							We believe in engaging the children in all our processes thus
							inculcating in them a feeling of ownership and greater
							responsibility. Our school policies are designed and executed
							through a collaborative effort between the students and teachers.

						<p>
							Hidden between the Sukhoi Fighter jets of the IAF station on one
							side and the jagged hills of the Western Ghats on the other, Aman
							Setu stands in the midst of farms on the Lohegaon-Wagholi road to
							the east of Pune. Drive down the undulating Wagholi-Lohegaon Road
							with fields stretching on either side till you reach a picturesque
							little cottage standing out against the wide sky. Our school
							houses flora and fauna not seen in the city, one cow, two cats,
							one dog and a host of butterflies. Our classrooms are within easy
							reach of the garden and children spend a great deal of time
							outdoors, farming, gardening and just being with nature.

						<h2 class="head-no-border">Competitions</h2>

						<p>
							In alignment with our philosophy, we encourage students only above
							Grade 3 to participate in competitive exams and inter-school
							competitions like the Olympiad - English, Maths, Science and GK,
							Spell Bee, Sci-Fests - Model Making and other cultural events.

							children with different learning needs like LD, ADHD etc. To
							ensure the diversity of each class the ratio of special needs
							children to mainstream children is 1:10.

							We provide students with 5 club options within school hours from
							which they can choose any one, each year.
