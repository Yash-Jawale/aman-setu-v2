							applying common sense and indigenous wisdom to the modern
							globalizing world. She strives towards building bridges between
							the past and the future, rural and urban children, the 'haves' and
							the 'have-nots', the east and the west in a healthy cross

							In 1986, she set up her first school - S.P.M. English School in
							the city of Pune. Together with her group of professional
							educationists, she innovated with prevailing systems, adapting

							environment of urbanizing India. The year 1995 witnessed her break
							new ground when, along with her team, she took the process forward
							by establishing a more developed institution - the Rewachand
							Bhojwani Academy - which, in time, has become a relevant and
							replicable model. In 2001, Ms. Kapur founded an educational trust
							THE MADHAVI KAPUR FOUNDATION - for the replication and scaling out
							of her work, so as to impact the wider educational system. She is
							the strong pillar of all the work of the Foundation and continues

						<p>Director of Interface</p>

					<div class="profile">
						<p>
							Anjali tai began her association with Adi in 1989. She initially
							was only a parent but Adi was able to identify in her an eagerness
							to teach using Adi’s innovative and experience based teaching
							methodology, and so asked her to be a Marathi teacher. Adi didn’t
							give much importance to qualifications and degrees, rather seeking
							out people who showed an enthusiasm to teach and learn, and bought
							into her philosophies of education. Once they were part of the
							school community they were always encouraged to study further. In
							1998 Anjali tai received an award from NCERT for the teaching
							methodologies she used in her classroom with non-marathi speaking
							children.
						</p>
						<p>
							At Aman Setu, Anjali tai is the Director of Interface and she
							works with parents, students and teachers alike. She has always
							been involved with Government and Zilla Parishad related work, and
							in the past has also supervised the Corporate Social
							Responsibility aspect of Keystone. She has also been a Marathi
							teacher at Aman Setu.
