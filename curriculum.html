							<h2>Pre-School</h2>
							<p>
								In Preschool, <strong><i>WE PLAY!</i></strong
								><br />
								We follow our own curriculum of learning through experiences and
								by focusing on skill building rather than abstract content.
								Everything is taught through stories, songs, games and drama.

							<h2>Primary School</h2>
							<p>
								We promise to give children a childhood! Over these four years
								we focus on building childrenâ€™s foundation for learning and on
								conceptual developements through our skill based learning
								programs.
							</p>
							<p>
								We supplement SSC textbooks with other texts, workbooks and
								manuals designed by our very own In House Curriculum development
								team.

							<h2>Secondary School</h2>
							<p>
								Secondary School means business! Students transition into more
								formal learning where the focus is on fine tuning and building
								upon concepts learnt previously. Students increasingly use
								Collaborative learning study skills, projects and research work
								along side classroom learning. This is also when they begin to
								take formal tests. In Grade 8, 9 and 10 students prepare for the
								SSC Board Exams.
